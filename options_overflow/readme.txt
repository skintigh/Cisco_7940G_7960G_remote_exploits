POC script for heap buffer overflow
Requires sipp
This POC overflows the 512 byte buffer created to store options. After parsing the options, the phone crashes when it tries to free the memory -- it seeme to be trying to free a negative remaining amount of memory. Since all stack addresses are fixed, and all memory executable, and the heap is essentially fixed after a reboot, this can likely be used for all sorts of mischief.
